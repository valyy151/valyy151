# Hi, I'm Vali ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer with experience in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). I'm passionate about reading, coding and problem solving.

## What I Do
- Develop web applications using the MERN stack
- Implement responsive design and cross-browser compatibility
- Develop RESTful APIs
- Write clean, maintainable, and efficient code
- Troubleshoot and debug complex issues

## What I'm Learning
###  TypeScript 
I'm really looking forward to using a statically-typed superset of JavaScript, and catching errors right on the start before they grow into big monsters later. ðŸ˜…  
###  Next.js  
I'm excited to dive into server-side rendering and static site generation. I've been hearing awesome things about it and I can't wait to see how it can help me level up my game! ðŸ˜€
